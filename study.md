## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
      I plan to review my wireframe in a one on one.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
      I plan to use arrays and objects to set up the gameboard and store the data
      of the users and the games.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
      Need to review this on a one on one
-   How you plan to approach this project.
      I plan to approach the project the same way we approached the sign up exercise we did in class,
      by starting with HTML and working through the ajax calls, testing the code along the way. I also plan
      on using the suggested schedule provided to us.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
- 
      "As a player, I want to play the game so I can win."

      "As a player, I want to have an account so I can see my past games."

      "As a player, I want to reset the game so I can start a new game."

      "As a player, I want to see the score so I know if I am winning."

      "As a winner of the game, I want the game to validate my win in a flashly way so the game
          will be more exciting."

      "As a designer or web developer, I want select my team color while playing this game so I can
          play with Hex values."

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
      I plan to separate out the code by elements, similar to how we separated out the authentication code in class.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
      I plan to show the Xs and Os on the board in a more abstract graphic way that traditionally shown.
-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
      I will commit to my git hub directories as I complete different elements of the game.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
      I would like to add a feature that allows users to input their own Hex value
      as the color for their team.
